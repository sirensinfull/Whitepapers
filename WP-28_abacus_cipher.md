### Abstract
The Abacus Cipher operates on the factor topology of the integer lattice rather than on arbitrary bit patterns. The key is not a number — it is a *walk* through a topological structure, navigated by domain-specific encodings (music, chemistry, psychology, language, mathematics, genetics, audio spectra) and transformed by the three kernel operations. The keyspace is topological, non-enumerable by any known method. Security is achieved through information asymmetry: the lattice walk generates more information than the input contains.

### Key Content
**§1 Integer Lattice as Cryptographic Space:** Every integer n has a unique position defined by its prime factorization = coordinate in k-dimensional space (one axis per prime). Tier = Ω(n) (total exponent sum). A lattice walk is an ordered sequence of positions = the key.

**§2 Domain Keyboards:** Music (notes → Hz → lattice position via 432 factorization), Chemistry (elements → Z → factor topology), Psychology (emotional states → resonance frequencies), Language (phonemes → formant frequencies → lattice), Mathematics (constants → integer approximations), Genetics (codons → amino acid Z values), Audio (spectral peaks → lattice positions). Each domain is an independent input method producing valid lattice coordinates.

**§3 The Walk as Encryption:** Plaintext → integer stream. Each integer enters the lattice at its natural position. The walk transforms each position through kernel operations determined by the key sequence. The transformed positions are the ciphertext. Decryption requires the same walk in reverse.

**§4 Structural Irreversibility:** The walk is generative — each step reveals lattice structure not present in the input. The ciphertext contains less information than needed for reconstruction. First encryption where irreversibility is structural, not computational.
