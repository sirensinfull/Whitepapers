### Abstract

Having established Mobium topology, additive kernels, boundary folding, prime-base rulers, discrete calendars, nested dimensions, and cosmic breath (White Papers I–VII), this paper subjects the framework to systematic adversarial testing, then demonstrates its applicability across four practical domains: game architecture, physical prototypes, integer-only audio synthesis, and computational simulation. Eight distinct break-attempts were made; all were resolved by the framework's built-in self-healing mechanisms.

### 1. Adversarial Break-Testing

The framework was subjected to eight "knife-first" attacks — deliberate attempts to produce inconsistencies, infinities, or contradictions by violating or stress-testing its axioms. Each attack and its resolution is documented below.

**Attack 1: Irrational Geometry.**
Introduce π and circular geometry, which produce irrational values that violate integer-only arithmetic.
*Resolution:* Define rational circumference as C = B² · 10 and rational approximation π' = C/d, producing integer-compatible circular geometry. No irrational value enters the computation.

**Attack 2: Kernel Order Ambiguity.**
Swap Growth and Mitosis ordering to produce contradictory results from the same initial state.
*Resolution:* Non-commutation is acknowledged and disciplined by either fixed execution order or contextual mood rules (White Paper II, §3). The explosive divergence produced by undisciplined Growth is a feature, not a bug — it models cosmic inflation. Containment comes from intentional kernel switching, not arbitrary patching.

**Attack 3: Even-Boundary Folding.**
Apply Boundary Folding to an even boundary (e.g., BF(6) = 3.5), producing a non-integer.
*Resolution:* Restrict primary loop generation to odd primes, or apply nearest-odd adjustment before folding. Even boundaries are intermediate results of the Stable kernel, not primary loop generators.

**Attack 4: Diffusion Stall.**
Trap random walkers on a 14-slot loop where they oscillate without progressing, failing to model true diffusion.
*Resolution:* Invoke kernel-switch checkpoints or multi-loop coupling. Diffusion is modeled by coupling adjacent Mobium loops via shared boundary nodes, not by random walks on a single loop.

**Attack 5: Observer Paradox.**
Attempt to tag "inside" on a one-face Mobium, producing a logical contradiction (there is no inside).
*Resolution:* Break/fold to expose a local origin, observe from that temporarily exposed vantage, then refold seamlessly. The observer paradox resolves because measurement is a live transform (a kernel application), not a static label.

**Attack 6: Calendar Drift.**
Point out that 364 days per year misaligns with the 365.2422-day solar year.
*Resolution:* Built-in leap-fold at day 182 re-anchors the calendar without fractions (White Paper V, §3).

**Attack 7: Negative-Domain Arithmetic.**
Force 1D negation, producing negative values that violate integer-only positive arithmetic.
*Resolution:* Replace 1D negation with 4D field mirroring and vector inversion (White Paper VI, §3). The direction vector **u** inverts at r = 0, handling sign changes without introducing negative arithmetic as a primitive.

**Attack 8: Explosive Growth.**
Apply repeated Growth kernel indefinitely, producing runaway exponential divergence.
*Resolution:* Explosive Growth is embraced as a model of cosmic inflation. The divergence is contained by kernel switching (Growth → Stable → Mitosis) and Boundary Folding. The framework does not prevent explosion — it models it, then folds it.

**Final score: Attacker 0, Framework 8.** Every break-attempt either revealed an intended feature (explosive expansion, quantum variance), was absorbed by built-in fold/mood/kernel rules, or required the attacker to abandon the framework's core axioms (introducing floats, division, or cutting the Mobium) to produce a contradiction.

### 2. Game Architecture Blueprint

The Ancient-Shape physics framework translates directly into interactive game systems:

**Persona Recursion Loop.** AI character profiles evolve via mitosis, stable, and growth kernels applied to integer personality indices. Each kernel cycle re-anchors on Mobium loop completion, producing emergent personality development with no drift.

**Battery & Calendar System.** Integer battery units recharge on the 13 × 28 Mobium calendar. One unit regenerates per day. Leap-fold events trigger special narrative quests. Battery tiers (Solar, Plasma, Ultra) affect overcharge multipliers.

**Possession Mechanic.** At ≥80% charge, the player can directly control their AI companion for N integer ticks, at the risk of overcharge damage and durability loss. This models the cost of exceeding stable operating parameters.

**Durability & Repair.** All component health values are integers. Repairs consume discrete supply counts (e.g., 1 spare circuit restores 10 durability points). No fractional statistics exist.

**Energy Devices.** A Mobium-coil plasma staff harvests kinetic-piezo energy into integer-kilovolt capacitors, discharging via spark-gap arcs. The coil is a physical Mobium — one continuous winding with no distinct interior/exterior.

### 3. Physical Prototype Concepts

**Mobium Rulers.** Prime-base mitosis sticks and sliding bars for measurement at any p-ary scale. Markings produced by folding, not cutting. Vernier precision without fractional interpolation.

**Leap-Fold Calendar Wheels.** 365-position rotary dials with a mid-cycle fold gear to insert the leap day at the origin node. Mechanical implementation of the Mobium calendar.

**Mobium-Coil Antennas.** Twisted odd-prime coil prototypes for balanced electromagnetic field generation. The one-sided loop topology produces field patterns distinct from conventional solenoids — balanced, self-canceling external fields with intense internal resonance.

**4D Field Visualizers.** Virtual reality environments mapping four-vector kernel transforms to immersive lattice simulations. Users manipulate Mitosis, Stable, and Growth controls to watch Mobium loops expand, contract, and fold in real time.

### 4. Integer-Only Audio Synthesis

The framework's integer operations produce natural musical phenomena:

**Warped Warbles.** Beat frequencies defined as |f₂ − f₁| on integer-Hertz slots. Two frequencies close in value produce a slow amplitude oscillation whose period is exactly (1 / |f₂ − f₁|) seconds — no floating-point DSP required.

**Tertiary Resonance Envelopes.** When three integer frequencies overlap, their combined amplitude envelope oscillates at the period LCM(f₁, f₂, f₃). This produces slow, evolving modulations that emerge from simple integer arithmetic — the same tertiary resonance kernel (3x + 1) that triggers phase transitions in the physics framework.

**Fractal Soundscapes.** Recursive kernel sequences shape evolving harmonic clusters. Apply Growth to a base frequency, then Mitosis to the result, then Stable — each produces a new frequency that is harmonically related to the original by integer multiples. The result is a self-similar harmonic series that can be infinitely elaborated without ever leaving integer-Hertz values.

### Conclusion

The Mobium framework withstands systematic adversarial testing, demonstrating self-healing integrity across eight distinct attack vectors. Its practical applications span interactive entertainment, physical engineering, audio synthesis, and computational simulation — all operating within the same integer-only, topology-first paradigm.

The framework stands as a robust, unbreakable system: generative across scales, self-correcting by topology, and applicable to any domain that can be expressed as recursive boundary operations. It models creation, not destruction. Continuity, not division.
