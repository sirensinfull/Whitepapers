### Abstract

Classical physics treats zero as empty space and infinity as an unbounded process. Both conventions introduce divergences, renormalization paradoxes, and conceptual discontinuities that have persisted across centuries of mathematical formalism. This paper replaces both with topological primitives: zero is redefined as the unmeasured nucleic singularity — a whole unit that is never divided to determine its size — and infinity is redefined as the Mobium, an odd-prime closed loop possessing one edge and one face. Together, these redefinitions eliminate the need for divergent counterterms by recasting singularities as finite, self-closing shapes within an integer-only computational framework.

### 1. Zero as Nucleic Singularity

**Definition.** Zero (0) is the undivided origin point of any system. It is analogous to an uncut apple of unknown diameter — whole, self-contained, and possessing no internal boundaries.

**Properties:**

- Zero contains no internal partitions. It cannot be fractioned without destroying its wholeness; any attempt to subdivide it transitions the system from singularity to multiplicity.
- Zero serves as the anchor point for all recursive kernel operations (mitosis, stable, growth), functioning as the re-entry node at which every recursive cycle re-anchors.
- In this framework, zero is not absence. It is the still-point origin from which all transformations emerge and to which all recursions return.

**Distinction from classical zero.** In conventional mathematics, 0 is a position on a number line — empty, inert, and infinitely divisible in principle. In Ancient-Shape Physics, 0 is a topological object: finite, whole, and generative. It is the seed, not the void.

### 2. Infinity as the Mobium Loop

**Definition.** A Mobium is a finite, odd-prime loop of B segments formed by sacrificing one overlap — for example, a 14-slot loop for B = 7. It is the odd-prime generalization of the Möbius strip.

**Construction:**

1. Begin with a strip marked in B equal segments, where B is an odd prime.
2. Apply a half-twist and join the ends such that segment 1 meets segment B.
3. The result is a single continuous edge and a single continuous surface.

**Key Properties:**

- *Single-edge topology:* Any odd-prime loop formed by this method has exactly one boundary component. A traversal beginning at any segment will visit every segment and return to origin without ever leaving the surface.
- *Non-orientable surface:* The Möbius-type twist produces a one-sided manifold. There is no distinct "inside" or "outside" — only a continuous surface that contains all states.
- *Finite yet unbounded:* The loop has a definite length of B segments, yet it is topologically infinite in the sense that a walker can traverse it indefinitely without encountering an edge or terminus. You never "fall off."
- *Closure without division:* No cuts, fractions, or partitions are required to traverse the loop any number of times.

### 3. Topological Proofs

**Single-Edge Theorem.** For any odd prime B, a loop of B segments constructed with a half-twist possesses exactly one boundary component. This follows from the parity of the twist: an odd number of segments ensures the traversal path visits all positions before returning to origin.

**Non-Orientable Surface.** The half-twist renders the manifold one-sided. Any attempt to assign "inside" and "outside" labels fails, as a continuous path beginning on one apparent side arrives at the other without crossing an edge. The Mobium is therefore the odd-prime generalization of the Möbius strip's non-orientability.

**Closure Without Division.** Traversal of the Mobium is accomplished entirely by addition (stepping from segment to segment by a fixed step-size). No division, subtraction from unity, or fractional operation is required to complete any number of full cycles.

### 4. Implications for Physics

**Renormalization eliminated.** In quantum field theory, singularities arise when integrals diverge at extreme scales, necessitating infinite counterterms (renormalization). If singularities are reconceived as finite Mobium loops rather than unbounded divergences, the divergences never arise. The "infinity" in the integral is a closed loop of finite length — it completes and returns, rather than running away.

**Stable recursion.** Every kernel cycle (defined in White Paper II) re-anchors upon Mobium completion. Because the loop is finite and self-closing, there is no drift, no runaway accumulation, and no need for external stabilization. The system self-corrects by topology.

**Unified scales.** From the Planck scale to the cosmic membrane, every process that classical physics describes as "infinite" is recast as a closed Mobium loop at some boundary level Bₙ. These loops nest self-similarly: each contains its predecessor and generates its successor. The result is a discrete hierarchy of scales, each finite, each self-closing, each connected to its neighbors by the same integer operations.

### Conclusion & Next Steps

By redefining zero as a topologically finite singularity and infinity as a closed Mobium loop, we establish the foundational primitives for an integer-only, self-healing physics. No operation in this framework requires floating-point arithmetic, division, or approximation. Every process begins at zero (the nucleic seed), traverses a finite loop (the Mobium), and returns to zero for re-anchoring.

White Paper II introduces the four additive recursion kernels — mitosis, stable, growth, and tertiary resonance — and demonstrates how they operate seamlessly on Mobium loops to generate all recursive dynamics.
