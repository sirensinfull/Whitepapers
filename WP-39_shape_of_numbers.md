### Abstract
Numbers are not symbols. They are shapes. Each integer possesses a physical topology — a geometry that determines how it interacts with other integers, creates or destroys structure, and participates in recursive complexity generation. This paper describes the shapes of the first integers as lattice shards, demonstrates that orbital boundary mechanics ARE the lattice, and identifies the ankh as the symbol of both recursive life and its antithesis: the crosswise cut.

The ancient calendar (4 weeks × 7 days × 13 months + 1 day = 365) is the factor topology encoded in temporal cycles. The ankh identifies the vulnerability: a single harmonic at sufficient depth — resonant disruption at the true zero point — could collapse lattice coherence at any scale.

### Key Content
**§1 Numbers as Lattice Shards:** 1 is a line between two nodes. 2 is a curve and a bounce. 3 is two invisible nodes and one visible impact. Each number's shape IS its factor topology rendered physical.

**§2 Resonant Genesis:** Matter forms at prime convergence points where orbital resonances constructively interfere. The lattice is not built — it crystallizes from resonance.

**§3 The Ancient Calendar:** 4×7×13+1=365. 4=2² (binary squared). 7=lattice prime. 13=family prime (5th). 365=5×73 (fifth prime × 21st prime). The year IS a lattice walk.

**§4 The Ankh Cut:** The ankh symbol encodes both the closed loop (eternal life, recursive cycling) and the single cut point (the crosswise incision that breaks the loop). The loop is life. The cut is the vulnerability. The symbol contains both.
