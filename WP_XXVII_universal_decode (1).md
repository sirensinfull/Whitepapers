### Abstract

Every encoding ever created — linguistic, mathematical, cryptographic, musical, architectural, theological, or computational — is a sigil library applied to a structural delta. The encoding PROCESS is always the same three operations: (1) extract operands from the source system, (2) assign symbols to operands, (3) compose relationships between symbols. The result is a two-document pair: library (symbol-to-meaning map) and delta (structural relationships in symbol form).

This paper formalizes the Universal Decode Method: given ANY encoded artifact, identify which elements are the sigil library and which are the delta, then apply the three inverse operations to reconstruct the source system.

### Key Content

**§1 The Invariant Encoding Process:** Three phases — Operand Extraction (K1 Mitosis), Symbol Assignment (K2 Stable), Relationship Composition (K3 Growth). The Invariant Decode reverses: Extraction (identify operands in the encoding), Classification (determine functional role of each), Reconstruction (recompose the source system from classified operands).

**§2 Decode Domain — Sacred Text:** YHVH decoded: Y (Yod=10) appears once → Growth operand. H (He=5) appears twice → Stable operand (repetition = maintenance). V (Vav=6) appears once → Stable operand (even, balanced). The Name encodes the three operations in its letter structure.

432 decoded: 2⁴×3³. Extract digits: 4, 3, 2. Classify: same as prime bases and exponents. The number contains its own construction recipe. 4+3+2 = 9 = 3² (ternary squared).

**§3 Decode Domain — Architecture:** The Pyramid decoded: base B, height H, ratio B/H ≈ π/2. Extract: B is Growth (full base extent), H is Mitosis (convergent reduction), ratio is Stable (the maintained proportion). The pyramid IS the (>0<) villa in stone.

**§4 Decode Domain — Music:** The discography as technical manual. Song structures encoding kernel operations through rhythmic and harmonic patterns. The Elena Proof: a specific musical work whose structural analysis reveals the framework's operations embedded in its composition.

**§5 Decode Domain — Cryptography:** Every cipher is a library swap. Substitution ciphers permute the library while preserving the delta. Transposition ciphers permute the delta while preserving the library. The decode method identifies which document was permuted and applies the inverse permutation.

**§6 Decode Domain — Genetics:** The genetic code IS an RSE library: 64 codons → 20 amino acids + stops. The genome IS an RSE delta: codon sequence encoding protein relationships. The decode method applied to genetics: extract codons, classify by amino acid function, reconstruct protein topology.

### Appendix A — Decode Demo

A worked example applying the Universal Decode Method to a specific encoded artifact, demonstrating the three-phase process from raw input through operand extraction, functional classification, and source reconstruction.
