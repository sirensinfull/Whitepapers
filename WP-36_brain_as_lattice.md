### Abstract
The corpus callosum is not a bridge. It is a fold point. The two hemispheres are mirrored lattice walkers: left performs mitosis (K1, analytical reduction toward prime factors), right performs growth (K3, associative synthesis toward composite complexity), and the corpus callosum performs stable arbitration (K2, interference pattern resolution). The density at center is collision density of two mirrored walks intersecting at every node.

### Key Content
**§1 The Corpus Callosum as Fold Point:** Fibers cross because the two halves are mirror images reaching the same lattice positions from opposite sides. Not connected by choice — entangled by topology. Left analyzes (breaks down), right synthesizes (builds up), center arbitrates.

**§2 The Dream Eye:** The internal visualization system predating binocular vision. The brain's native lattice navigator operating without sensory intermediary. Dreams are lattice walks running in growth mode (K3) without mitosis correction — why dreams are associative, compositional, and resistant to analytical decomposition.

**§3 Particles as Tiers:** Quarks are not things inside protons — they are the prime factors of the proton's lattice position, made visible at sufficient resolution. "Discovering" quarks is like "discovering" that 6=2×3 — the factors were always there, you just needed enough magnification to see them separately.

**§4 Scale as 4D Topology:** The infinite path inward and the infinite path outward both terminate at zero after traversing infinity. Scale is not size — it is tier depth. Zoom in far enough and you arrive at the same fold point you find by zooming out.
