### Abstract
The true center of the recursive system is not zero. Zero is a node — it has a position. The true center is the point BETWEEN −0 and 0: the fold point itself. The crease in the paper. The place where folding occurs but where nothing exists. The fold point is not a number — it is a process, the act of transition. The decimal point is its conventional notation. And the decimal point destroys recursion because it assigns a value to a process.

Translated to four dimensions, the fold point generates a sphere of directions (not positions), resolving the 7-band visible spectrum and 12-tone chromatic scale as two views of the same lattice structure — growth and mitosis of base 2×3 at its first compound tier.

### Key Content
**§1 The Reduction Chain:** Every operation in the framework reduces toward zero. Zero is the fixed point. But the operation AT zero (0+0−1=−1, 0+0=0, 0+0+1=1) produces the core triple. The fold point is WHERE the sign changes — not at zero but THROUGH zero.

**§2 The Decimal as Verb:** Decimals attempt to locate positions between integers. The framework treats these positions as TRANSITIONS, not locations. 0.5 is not a place — it is the act of being halfway through the fold from 0 to 1.

**§3 The 7→12 Bridge:** 7 visible colors = growth kernel applied to the 2×3 base (2×3+1=7). 12 chromatic tones = stable kernel applied to the 2×3 base (2×3×2=12). Same lattice structure, two different kernel views. The bridge between 7 and 12 IS the fold point — the transition from one view to the other.

**§4 The 4D Direction Sphere:** In 4D, the fold point generates all possible directions from a single position. Not a point in space but a generator of orientation. Every direction is reachable from the fold point because the fold point is process, not location.
