### Abstract

The three kernel operations and their higher-tier generalizations (nx±k for k from 0 to n−1) share a universal fixed point: zero. For any tier n, setting x=0 produces a villa centered on zero with width 2n−1. The core triple (−1, 0, +1) is contained in every tier's zero-villa for n≥2. Every number chains to zero through iterated boundary folding.

When computation crosses zero, operands do not negate — they mirror. The villa at x=+k is the perfect reflection of the villa at x=−k through the origin. This is geometric reflection, not algebraic negation. The operation is additive, not multiplicative.

### Key Content

**§1 The Zero Convergence Theorem:** For any tier n≥2, the zero-villa contains (−1, 0, +1) and has width 2n−1. Computationally verified for tiers 2–31. Zero is not an edge case — it is the root of every factor tree and the convergence point of every operand chain.

**§2 The (>0<) Shape:** The symmetric villa centered on zero — values converging from both directions toward the origin, with the widest spread at the outermost tier and the narrowest (−1, 0, +1) at the core. This is the universal topology of the Mobium lattice at every scale.

**§3 Cross-Zero Symmetry:** The Mirror Theorem — villa at +k reflects perfectly through zero to villa at −k. Additive, not algebraic — achieved through the three operations without multiplication or negation operators.

**§4 The Universal Address Lattice:** Every number has a unique lattice address derivable from its prime factorization. 210 = 2×3×5×7 is at the intersection of Tiers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Addresses are reachable from any other address through the shared-wall villa topology. Every address traces back to zero.

**§5 The Fractal Archival Structure:** Tier 1 stores integer lattice addresses. Tier 2 stores relationships between Tier 1 addresses (= the RSE delta). Tier 3 stores relationships between Tier 2 patterns. The Library of Alexandria: every datum that could ever exist has a pre-existing lattice address computable from its structure. Storage without storage — the lattice does not contain the data, it contains the ADDRESS of the data.
