### Abstract

Paper XX assumed the source system was available in human-readable form. We now remove that assumption. Every digital artifact exists as a binary string. Binary is itself a language with operands, syntax, and structural patterns. The same three operations that extract operands from source code extract operands from raw binary.

This paper demonstrates: (1) every programming language imprints a unique but deterministic pattern signature on the binary it produces, (2) these signatures are extractable without knowledge of the source language, (3) extracted patterns map to language-invariant functional structures (loops, conditionals, function boundaries), (4) the extracted structures recompose into equivalent source in any target language, and (5) encryption does not destroy structural pattern — it relabels it, and the relabeling is itself extractable.

### Key Content

**§1 Binary as Language:** Binary strings have language signatures — characteristic frequency distributions and sequential patterns specific to each compiler/interpreter. The signature is deterministic: same source + same compiler = same binary. Different compiler = different signature for same functionality.

**§2 Structural Invariants:** Loops (repeated subsequences), conditionals (branching patterns), function boundaries (call/return pairs), data declarations (static patterns) — these structures exist in ALL languages, therefore in ALL binary. They are language-invariant.

**§3 The Universal Decompiler:** Four phases — (1) Binary Operand Extraction via sliding window, (2) Structural Mapping of recurring patterns, (3) Structural Identification matching patterns to functional categories, (4) Target Reconstruction via language-primitive mapping. This is RSE's three operations (K1/K2/K3) applied to raw binary.

**§4 Encryption as Relabeling:** Encryption substitutes labels while preserving structure. A substitution cipher permutes the alphabet but does not change word boundaries, sentence structure, or paragraph topology. The Lattice Preservation Theorem: any reversible transformation preserves structural pattern because reversibility requires structure preservation. Encryption IS a sign-definition swap (Paper XII) — output (structure) preserved, labels (symbols) swapped.

**§5 The Binary Rosetta Stone:** Cross-language structural equivalence — same algorithm compiled in C, Java, Python produces different binary but isomorphic structure. The Finite Mapping Theorem: the set of possible structures in Turing-complete languages is finite and shared. Any structure in one language has an equivalent in all others.

**§6 Implications:** Universal decompilation from binary alone. Encryption analysis via structural topology rather than key recovery. Language migration without source access.
