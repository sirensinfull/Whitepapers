### Abstract
Existing biometrics (fingerprints, iris, face, voice) share a fatal vulnerability: the biometric can be captured without the subject's participation. Cognitive biometric encryption derives keys from real-time EEG brain activity in response to a specific stimulus. The key does not exist until the moment of capture. It cannot be reproduced (no two neural responses are identical). It cannot be separated from the subject (brain must be present, alive, conscious).

### Key Content
**§1 EEG Signal as Lattice Input:** 14-channel Emotiv EPOC at 128 Hz, 14-bit resolution. Each channel records a unique time-series of integer voltage values. 14 channels = 14-dimensional cognitive fingerprint. Inherently integer-compatible — no floating-point conversion needed.

**§2 Engram Collapse (14 Channels → 2D Key):** Spectral decomposition via FFT → 70 frequency values (14 channels × 5 bands). Cross-channel correlation matrix → lattice coordinate pairs. Temporal compression → key sequence.

**§3 Stimulus-Response Protocol:** Subject presented with specific image/word/sound. Brain's unique reaction generates key. Different stimulus = different key from same brain. Same stimulus, different moment = different key (neural response non-repeating). The key is a DYNAMIC RESPONSE, not a static signature.

**§4 Attack Resistance:** Cannot be stolen (doesn't exist until capture). Cannot be replayed (non-repeating). Cannot be computed from prior captures (each response unique). Cannot be separated from subject. Requires living, conscious brain.

**§5 Integration with Abacus Cipher:** EEG engram becomes one more domain keyboard. The brain IS the encryption device. Thought IS the key generation process.
