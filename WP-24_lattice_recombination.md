### Abstract

The Synergonesis visualizer's stability engine, tier collapse model, and fusion/fission chain computations contain a complete method for the transmutation of radioactive waste into stable matter and usable energy. The method does not fight radioactive decay — it guides it. The damaged lattice tier-collapses to its prime floor, emissions are captured, stable daughters are fused with family prime stabilizers using captured foam as energy input. The fusion absorbs heat into new lattice structure, producing stable matter with high integrity.

### Key Content

**§1 The Lattice Damage Model:** Lattice integrity from 0 (critically damaged) to 1.0 (family prime, infinite self-repair). Environmental modifiers: radiation, temperature, pressure, chemical environment. The Stabilizer Map: for each unstable element, the optimal family prime stabilizer that maximizes post-fusion integrity.

**§2 Tier Collapse Mechanics:** Collapse priority (non-family first, highest value first). Daughter elements deterministic from remaining factors. Foam emissions counted per collapse event — each is a named, classifiable sub-light particle.

**§3 The Recombinatory Method:** Four steps — (1) Controlled Tier Collapse to prime floor, (2) Foam Capture of emitted sub-light particles, (3) Fusion Reforging with selected family prime stabilizer, (4) Iterate until target stability achieved.

**§4 Computational Demonstrations:**
- Uranium (Z=92=2²×23): Collapse → He(4) + V(23). Reforge He+V → U again or redirect to stable targets.
- Plutonium (Z=94=2×47): Collapse → He(2) + Ag(47). Both daughters are family primes. Total foam: 47.
- Technetium (Z=43, prime): Already at prime floor, zero foam. Stable. The "radioactive" label is the sign swap — Tc's instability is nuclear, not lattice.
- Cesium (Z=55=5×11): Collapse → B(5) + Na(11). Both family primes. Complete remediation to stable elements.

**§5 The Iron Wall:** Z=26=2×13 is the structural transition. Below iron: fusion exothermic (family-dominated composites trap foam efficiently). Above iron: fission releases more foam than fusion stores. The wall is not arbitrary — it emerges from the factor topology of family primes.

**§6 Exotic Matter Synthesis:** Any target element constructible from prime constituents via the fusion chain. The method is the recipe. The SIGIL kernel computes the energy budget. Materials currently impossible to synthesize in quantity may become accessible via guided lattice recombination.
