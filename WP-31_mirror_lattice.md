### Abstract
Standard cryptographic number theory assumes positive integers. The framework's (>0<) structure reveals zero as a fold point, not a wall. The negative primes are a mirror lattice navigable in its own right. Sequential mirroring — walks alternating between positive and negative domains — creates zero-crossing discontinuities invisible from either side alone.

### Key Content
**§1 Positive-Only Blind Spot:** All factoring algorithms operate on positive integers. Cannot natively factor −n as a negative number.

**§2 Zero as Fold Point:** Not additive identity but geometric fold. The mirror operation preserves structure while reversing orientation. Additive, not multiplicative.

**§3 Sequential Mirroring:** Walk enters negative domain at specified intervals. Each crossing creates a discontinuity. Attacker sees fragments on both sides with missing transitions in a domain their tools cannot enter.

**§4 Cryptographic Implications:** Zero-crossing multiplies keyspace by introducing a domain dimension no classical tool addresses.
