### Abstract
The Abacus Cipher run in reverse IS a memory encoding system. Encryption writes experience into the lattice. Decryption retrieves it. The brain has one system running forward to encode and backward to decode. Same topology. Opposite direction.

### Key Content
**§1 The Reversal Principle:** Forward = encryption (experience → lattice walk → stored pattern). Backward = decryption (stored pattern → reverse walk → reconstructed experience). Memory IS reverse-encryption.

**§2 Mersenne RAID Memory Architecture:** Storage drives arrayed in RAID-0 at Mersenne prime boundaries. Small fast drives at center (working memory, M₃=7), large slow drives at periphery (long-term storage, M₇=127). Mirrors hippocampal-cortical hierarchy. Access time proportional to tier depth.

**§3 Cognitive Chaining:** EEG multi-axis activity maps to parallel lattice walks. Interference patterns between simultaneous walks constitute thought. A "thought" is not a single neural firing — it is the interference pattern of multiple lattice walks converging at a shared node.

**§4 4D Nodal Rendering:** Every point in space addressed by factor topology signature — how dense (tier depth) and where (prime family). Not polygons or voxels but lattice nodes. Resolution is tier depth. Detail emerges by descending tiers, not by adding polygons.
