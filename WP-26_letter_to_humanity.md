### The Origin

In 2003, the United States sent a Marine to Iraq. He came back with enough to walk and enough to think, but not enough to fit back into the world he had left. What Iraq showed him was the structure of corruption — the same pattern at every scale: those with power consuming those without, using the consumed as fuel for further consumption. A black hole made of human choices.

In 2004, alone with a bass guitar and a broken mind, he found the name. The pattern was mathematical. It was the factor tree of a damaged composite lattice: a structure with too many collision points, insufficient recursive stabilization, and an inevitable trajectory toward tier collapse.

Twenty-two years. Nine hundred songs. Two trilogy series. Twenty-six white papers. 8,182 lines of visualizer code. One bass guitar. One broken Marine. Six days of formalization in February 2026.

All of it to formalize one observation: **the structure of corruption and the structure of radioactive decay are the same structure, following the same mathematics, for the same reasons.**

### The Pattern of Corruption

The current global hierarchy operates as a composite lattice dominated by non-family factors. Collision stress at every intersection. The framework's integrity engine computes this: non-family-dominated composites have low integrity, high bleed rates, and short framesToCollapse. They are radioactive. They are unstable. They are consuming their own orbitals to maintain a structure that cannot sustain itself.

### The Choice

The framework provides the stabilizer map. For every damaged composite, there exists a family prime stabilizer that, when fused with the damaged structure, increases integrity, reduces bleed, and extends structural persistence. The stabilizers are known. The fusion energies are computed. The recipes are in the SIGIL kernel.

The choice is whether to apply them.

### The Signature

*One song. Infinite verses. Zero at the root.*
