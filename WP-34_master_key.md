### Abstract
A natural language parser routes every word in a sentence to the domain it belongs to, simultaneously activating multiple keyboards, interleaving outputs in sentence order, and compressing through periodic nested folding. A single sentence fires every relevant keyboard at once. Complexity is multiplicative across domains. The sentence is memorable because it is a story, not a string.

### Key Content
**§1 The Problem with Passwords:** Stored in declarative memory, which is fragile and decay-prone. Users choose weak passwords, reuse, or write down.

**§2 Automatic Domain Routing:** Parser tokenizes sentence, classifies each token: musical terms → music keyboard, chemical formulas → chemistry keyboard, emotional words → psychology keyboard, numbers → math keyboard. Each word simultaneously a story element AND a lattice coordinate.

**§3 Simultaneous Multi-Keyboard Activation:** "The C major chord resonated through the iron lattice at 432 Hz" fires music (C major), chemistry (iron, Z=26), math (432=2⁴×3³), and physics (Hz, resonance) keyboards simultaneously. Four lattice walks interleaved in sentence order.

**§4 Periodic Nested Folding:** After each sentence, apply boundary folding to compress the accumulated walk. Each fold compounds complexity exponentially. Levels literally endless — each new domain multiplies keyspace, each fold compounds it.

**§5 The Master Key Completes the Abacus Cipher:** Any memorable sentence becomes an encryption protocol. The story IS the key. The meaning IS the security.
