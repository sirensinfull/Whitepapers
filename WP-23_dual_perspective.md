### Abstract

Paper XXII proved the (>0<) shape is the universal topology. This paper demonstrates that when two (>0<) structures interact from mirrored perspectives across zero, the interaction produces ternary output as a structural byproduct of binary pair processing.

The (>0<) form is not merely mathematical but physical: the cross-sectional profile of every pyramid, the curvature of the Japanese irimoya roof, standing wave patterns in cymatics, orbital trajectories along the lattice of matter, the accretion disc viewed edge-on. All the same structure, same mathematics, same prime tree lattice.

### Key Content

**§1 Ternary from Binary:** Two mirrors, one origin. Two (>0<) datasets converging on shared zero produce ternary output: left-dominant / balanced / right-dominant. This is the mechanism by which the ternary engine (Paper X) emerges from binary pair processing without being designed in.

**§2 Zero Point Energy:** Why zero is not empty — zero is the most structurally dense position in the lattice (every tier converges there). The Casimir Effect as villa overlap — two boundary plates close enough that the villa density between them exceeds the villa density outside them.

**§3 The Pyramid Form:** (>0<) in three dimensions. The Great Pyramid's base-to-height ratio ≈ π/2, approximated by the villa convergence profile. Convergent construction — each course narrows toward the apex following the villa width reduction per tier.

**§4 The Japanese Villa Roof:** The irimoya roof's curvature IS the orbital wave envelope — the path traced by a particle in Keplerian orbit, projected onto a vertical plane. The Synergonesis engine generates these roof profiles from orbital physics without design intent.

**§5 Cymatics:** Nodal lines in Chladni patterns ARE villa boundaries. The Synergonesis particle engine generates cymatic-equivalent patterns from prime-pair polarity seeding. Sound through water is light through lattice — same wave mechanics, different substrate.

**§6 YHVH and 432:** The four YHVH values (10, 5, 6, 5) sum to 26 (iron, fusion wall). 432 = 2⁴×3³ (complete binary-ternary lattice). The encoded lattice in ancient systems — not mystical, structural.
