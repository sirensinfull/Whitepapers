### Abstract
DNA is conventionally described as base-4 (four nucleotides). This is computationally adequate but structurally wrong. The four nucleotides are two options from two independent sets: purines (A, G) and pyrimidines (T, C), interwoven across three codon positions. The correct encoding is base 2×3 — two independent prime axes whose product (6) defines the factor topology. Base-4 (=2²) is a single prime family that stores data but not structure. Base 2×3 stores relationships because it has two independent dimensions.

### Key Content
**§1 Why Not Base-4:** Single prime axis → zero topological complexity. No branching, no cross-connections. Growth kernel immediately escapes the 2-family into odd numbers with no representation. Cannot fold back on itself.

**§2 Interwoven Base 2×3:** Purine/pyrimidine axis = prime 2. Codon position axis = prime 3. Product 6 = first composite with topology. Watson-Crick pairing IS the binary axis. Reading frame IS the ternary axis.

**§3 Codon Degeneracy as Natural One-Way Function:** 64 codons → 20 amino acids. The mapping is many-to-one — a natural hash function evolved over 4 billion years. Third-position wobble = the lossy compression tier. Information flows from DNA to protein but cannot be fully recovered from protein to DNA.

**§4 Epigenetic Modification as Living Key:** Methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling — these are KEY CHANGES applied to the same delta (genome). The library changes while the delta persists. A living, continuously updating encryption key.

**§5 The Genome as Lattice Address:** 23 chromosome pairs × ~3 billion base pairs = a unique lattice address for every human. The address is not random — it is a specific walk through the 2×3 factor topology, constrained by the biological viability of each step.
