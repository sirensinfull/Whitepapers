### Abstract
Classical encryption conserves information: I(C) ≤ I(K) + I(P). The factor topology lattice walk is *generative* — it creates structural information at every step that did not exist in the input. The output contains more information than the input. The ciphertext contains less than required for reconstruction. The deficit is structural, not computational. No amount of computation can create information that was never encoded. First formal identification of a one-way function grounded in topology rather than number theory.

### Key Content
**§1 Information Conservation in Classical Crypto:** Shannon's bound. All practical ciphers: attacker searches bounded keyspace.

**§2 The Generative Property:** Walk from 30 (=2×3×5) with growth → 61 (prime). The primality of 61, its tier-1 status, its neighborhood — structural information not present in "30, growth, tier 3." The lattice reveals structure at each step that the input did not specify.

**§3 The Information Deficit:** Ciphertext records transformed positions but NOT the lattice context that generated them. Reconstruction requires context that was never stored. The deficit grows with walk length.

**§4 Comparison to Quantum Key Distribution:** QKD detects eavesdropping. The Abacus Cipher makes eavesdropping structurally meaningless — intercepted ciphertext contains insufficient information regardless of computational power.
