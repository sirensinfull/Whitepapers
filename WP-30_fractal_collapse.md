### Abstract
At sufficient tier depth (12+), the factor topology lattice is *closed*. Its boundary conditions are identical on all sides — a Möbius loop, not a Euclidean plane. Every maximal walk returns to its origin. Every key is a cycle, not a line. The attacker cannot work backward from a destination because the destination wraps to the origin.

### Key Content
**§1 Node Density at High Tiers:** Super-exponential growth. By tier 12, every node's neighborhood is statistically unique (consequence of fundamental theorem of arithmetic).

**§2 The Neighborhood IS the History:** Unique neighborhoods mean each position encodes its full recursion history. The local lattice shape around a node is the consequence of every operation that placed the walk there.

**§3 The Closure Property:** At sufficient depth, walks loop. The (>0<) boundary conditions ensure −1=−0=0=1=∞ topologically. The lattice is self-sealing.

**§4 Crosswise Incision:** The only attack is cutting across the path rather than following it, requiring visibility of the path, requiring the topology, requiring the key. The recursion is self-sealing.
