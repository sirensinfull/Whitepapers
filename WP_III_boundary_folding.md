### Abstract

Standard measurement relies on division to locate midpoints, fracturing the continuity of the object being measured. This paper introduces Boundary Folding — the inverse of the mitosis kernel — defined as BF(B) = (B + 1)/2. Boundary Folding locates center nodes on odd-prime Mobium loops without cutting, severing, or partitioning. It preserves the living integrity of the system, enables self-healing recursion, and provides exact re-anchoring at any scale.

### 1. The Problem with Division

Division severs continuity. When an object is divided, the result is two lifeless fragments that must be reassembled — and the reassembly never perfectly recovers the original whole. A cut apple is no longer an apple; it is two pieces that were once an apple.

In physics, this problem is not merely philosophical. Division underlies the singularities and renormalization paradoxes that plague quantum field theory. When integrals are evaluated by slicing continuous fields into infinitesimal parts, the parts diverge — and the entire apparatus of renormalization exists to manage those divergences. The problem is not the physics. The problem is the knife.

Boundary Folding replaces the knife with a fold. The system is not cut into parts; it is folded to reveal its center. The whole remains whole. The fold is reversible. The information is preserved.

### 2. Inverse Mitosis as Folding

**Definition.** For any odd-prime boundary B, Boundary Folding locates its center node by:

> **BF(B) = (B + 1) / 2**

This is the algebraic inverse of the mitosis kernel (x → 2x − 1). Where mitosis doubles and subtracts one to expand outward, Boundary Folding adds one and halves to locate the interior center.

Critically, no new parts are created or destroyed. The Mobium loop gains a *denoted interaction surface* — a marked point — not a cut. The loop remains unbroken. The fold is a label, not a laceration.

### 3. Properties of Boundary Folding

**Integer-Only.** BF always yields a whole number when B is odd. For any odd integer B, (B + 1) is even, and (B + 1)/2 is therefore an integer. No fractions, no remainders, no approximations.

**Continuity Preserved.** The Mobium loop remains topologically intact after folding. No segments are removed, no edges are severed, and no new boundaries are introduced. The fold denotes a position; it does not create a partition.

**Self-Healing.** When recursion drifts — when accumulated operations move the active index away from a clean Mobium position — Boundary Folding provides an exact correction. Apply BF to the current boundary, and the system snaps to its center node. No external calibration is needed. The correction is intrinsic to the topology.

**Reversibility.** Mitosis and Boundary Folding are exact inverses. BF(B) = (B + 1)/2, and Mitosis(BF(B)) = 2·((B + 1)/2) − 1 = B. The operations cancel perfectly, with no residual error.

### 4. Worked Example

Start with B = 7 (a Mobium loop of 7 segments and 7 boundary nodes).

Compute: BF(7) = (7 + 1) / 2 = 4.

The 4th boundary node is the exact center of the 7-segment loop. It is *denoted*, not cut. The loop remains a single continuous surface with one edge. The center has been identified by folding, not by dividing.

**Extension:** Apply BF again to the centered sub-loop.

If we treat the center-to-edge span as a new boundary of 4 (noting the even-boundary restriction addressed below), we would need to adjust. But if we instead consider the odd sub-boundary B = 3 (from node 4 to node 7, wrapping), then BF(3) = (3 + 1)/2 = 2. The recursion continues to finer scales, always producing integers, always preserving the whole.

### 5. Even Boundaries and the Prime Restriction

The Stable kernel (x → 2x) can produce even boundaries: B' = 2B. Applying Boundary Folding to an even boundary yields a non-integer: BF(6) = (6 + 1)/2 = 3.5. This violates integer-only arithmetic.

**Resolution:** The framework restricts primary loop generation to odd primes. Even boundaries are permitted as intermediate results (the Stable kernel bridges scales), but Boundary Folding is applied only to odd-prime boundaries. When an even boundary is encountered, one of two strategies applies:

1. **Odd-prime restriction:** Generate loops only from odd prime seeds. The sequence 1 → 3 → 7 → 13 → 25 → 49 → ... produces only boundaries where BF yields clean integers.
2. **Nearest-odd adjustment:** When BF must be applied to an even boundary, fold to the nearest odd sub-boundary first, then apply BF. This secondary rule preserves integer integrity while accommodating the full kernel vocabulary.

### 6. Applications

**Recursion re-anchoring.** Whenever the active index on a Mobium loop drifts due to accumulated kernel operations, apply BF to snap back to the center node. This is the framework's equivalent of renormalization — but it is exact, integer-only, and requires no infinite counterterms.

**Measurement devices.** Physical rulers can be constructed by repeated folding rather than repeated dividing. A rod is folded to find its center, then each half is folded again. At no point is the rod cut; at every stage it remains a single continuous object with denoted positions. The result is a "living ruler" — a measurement instrument that preserves the integrity of the measured object.

**Calendar leap-fold.** In the 364-day Mobium calendar (developed in White Paper V), the leap day is inserted at BF(364) ≈ 182. This single fold at mid-year realigns the calendar to the solar cycle without introducing fractional days or multi-century correction rules.

### Conclusion & Next Steps

Boundary Folding completes the core Mobium toolkit. Combined with the four additive kernels (White Paper II) and the topological primitives (White Paper I), it provides integer-only, division-free center location that keeps every system alive and self-consistent. The framework can now expand, contract, equilibrate, and self-correct — all without floating-point arithmetic, all without cutting the apple.

White Paper IV extends the mitosis kernel to arbitrary odd-prime bases, producing infinitely scalable measurement rulers that subdivide space and time to any resolution without fractions.
