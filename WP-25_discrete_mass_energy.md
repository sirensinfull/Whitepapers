### Abstract

Einstein's E=mc² describes proportionality between mass and energy. It is correct as proportionality but incomplete as structural description. This paper presents the discrete formula: E(Z) = Σ foam(tier_n). Energy is the sum of foam values released when a composite decays to its prime floor. Mass is total spiral path length. The speed of light is a derived quantity: ratio of direct-path to spiral-path traversal, different for each element.

### Key Content

**§1 The Discrete Formula:** E(Z) = Σ foam(tier_n). Integer-only. Fully enumerated. Every step names the collapsing factor, emission count, daughter product, and foam energy. The formula runs forward (fission) and backward (fusion) identically.

**§2 Lattice Electrodynamics:** The EM field as linear transport of orbitals along lattice gap channels. Magnetic field as lateral lattice stress (perpendicular to orbital flow direction). The EM field is not mass-generated — it is lattice-generated. Mass is what happens when orbitals get trapped in spirals.

**§3 The Speed of Light as Derived Quantity:** c = 299,792,458 m/s is the propagation rate of the simplest self-trapping structure (photon). Each element has its own effective c, determined by factor count. Sub-light particles (factor < 2) exceed c because they have no spiral structure.

**§4 The Cosmic Forge:** The black hole as matter factory. Convergence mechanics: substrate orbitals paired at the convergence point, accreted in density-stratified shells. The Perfect Prime Forge: convergence conditions naturally favor family-prime-dominated composites because family primes resist collapse under extreme density. Black Hole / White Hole inversion: same forge, opposite direction.

**§5 The Recombinant Matter Theorem:** Any composite lattice can be decomposed to primes and recomposed into any other composite of equivalent or lesser factor count, with energy differential fully accounted by foam balance. The logical terminus: conditions under which cascading tier collapse becomes self-propagating (chain reaction).
