## Overview

Ancient-Shape Physics is an integer-only, topology-first framework for modeling recursive systems across all scales of reality. It replaces floating-point approximation with exact integer arithmetic, replaces division with boundary folding, and replaces infinite divergences with finite Mobium loops.

The framework is built on three additive kernels — mitosis (2x−1), stable (2x), and growth (2x+1) — which constitute the minimum and sufficient operations for all generative recursion.

## The Papers

| # | Title | Summary |
|---|-------|---------|
| I | [Zero as Singularity & Mobium as Finite Infinity](papers/WP_I_zero_singularity_mobium.md) | Redefines zero as undivided origin and infinity as a finite closed loop |
| II | [Additive Kernels & the Ternary Recursion Engine](papers/WP_II_additive_kernels.md) | Defines the four integer-only kernels that drive all recursion |
| III | [Boundary Folding: Inverse Mitosis Without Division](papers/WP_III_boundary_folding.md) | Locates centers without cutting — division-free measurement |
| IV | [Prime-Base Mitosis & Infinitely Scalable Rulers](papers/WP_IV_prime_base_mitosis.md) | Extends subdivision to any odd-prime base for infinite precision |
| V | [Discrete Cosmology: Mobium Time & Leap-Fold Calendars](papers/WP_V_mobium_time.md) | Integer-only 13×28 calendar system with built-in leap correction |
| VI | [Nested Dimensions & 4D Field Dynamics](papers/WP_VI_nested_dimensions.md) | Dimensions as emergent tiers of substance, not coordinate axes |
| VII | [Cosmic Breath: Four-Phase Universal Recursion](papers/WP_VII_cosmic_breath.md) | Replaces Big Bang with eternal four-phase respiration cycle |
| VIII | [Applications & Unbreakable Integrity](papers/WP_VIII_applications_integrity.md) | Eight adversarial break-tests; all resolved by built-in self-healing |
| IX | [Holifractal Field Dynamics & 4D Vector Radii](papers/WP_IX_holifractal_field_dynamics.md) | Full 4D vector field framework with smooth singularity traversal |
| X | [The Universal Ternary Engine & Scale-Invariant Triads](papers/WP_X_universal_ternary_engine.md) | The minimal three-agent recursion underlying all complexity |

## The Core Claim

Three operations — **x+x−1**, **x+x**, **x+x+1** — applied recursively from any seed, produce contiguous coverage of the entire number line. The tier sizes follow Mersenne numbers (2ⁿ−1). No gaps. Any seed. Any scale.

This is not an approximation. It is arithmetic. It is verifiable in three lines of code.

## Reading Order

The papers are numbered sequentially and each builds on its predecessors. Start with Paper I. By Paper X, the entire framework is established.

For those coming from conventional physics: Papers I, II, and III establish the operational vocabulary. Paper VI is where the dimensional framework diverges from standard spacetime. Paper VII is the cosmological model. Paper X is the synthesis.

For those coming from computer science: Papers I–III give you the algorithm. Paper IV gives you scalable measurement. Paper VIII gives you game architecture. The [implementation repositories](#related-repositories) contain running code.
